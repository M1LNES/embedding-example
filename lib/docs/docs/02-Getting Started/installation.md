## Installation

Library can be installed by executing command

```cmd title="Npm installation"
npm install empliembed
```

or just

```cmd title="Npm installation"
npm i empliembed
```

## Importing

Library (so far) contains two important components. Their usage will be explained in next chapter. These components can be imported via

```jsx title="Library import"
import { Widget, WidgetVision } from 'empliembed'
```
